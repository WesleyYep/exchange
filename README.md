# Sorted Exchange

This is a project to experiment with different technologies. The focus of the project is a trading exchange. It is a simple Limit Order exchange that can take orders and match them. It publishes trades from matching orders and snapshots of the order books on chnage.

This is a "Dev Ops" project with each of the elements wrapped in a docker image and the whole system available via docker-compose. Eventually, the build will be 'dockerised' too.
